gitignore.mirror is a comprehensive collection of .gitignore templates curated and maintained by GitHub. These templates serve as standardized guidelines for developers to configure which files and directories should be excluded from version control in Git repositories. The collection is used to populate the .gitignore template, simplifying repository creation by providing language- and framework-specific ignore rules. Templates are organized into several directories: common-use templates at the root, Global templates for editors and operating systems, and community templates for specialized tools and projects. Each template is designed to be minimal yet effective, ensuring that unnecessary or environment-specific files are not accidentally committed. The project also includes clear contributing guidelines, encouraging developers to propose new templates or updates that are well-documented, scoped appropriately, and beneficial to the broader community.
